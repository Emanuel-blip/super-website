# Website Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Language Switching Issues on AI Prompts Page
**Problem**: Language switching was not working on the AI Prompts page - content remained in Armenian even when English was selected.

**Root Cause**: Missing translation keys in the `translations.js` file for AI Prompts page content.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added missing translation keys for AI Prompts page in `src/translations.js`
- Added translations for:
  - `aiPromptsTitle`: "AI Prompts Art"
  - `aiPromptsSubtitle`: "Learn to create effective prompts for AI systems"
  - `foundPrompts`: "Found prompts"

### 2. Black Screen Issue with Start Learning Button
**Problem**: Clicking the "Start Learning" button caused a black screen or navigation failure.

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues found:
1. JavaScript error in `LearningPage.jsx` - using undefined `language` variable instead of `currentLanguage`
2. Incorrect navigation method in `CTAButtons.jsx` - using `window.location.href` instead of React Router's `useNavigate`

**Fixes Applied**:
- **LearningPage.jsx**: Replaced all instances of `language` with `currentLanguage` throughout the component
- **CTAButtons.jsx**: 
  - Added `import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'`
  - Replaced `window.location.href = '/learning'` with `navigate('/learning')`
  - Updated all navigation handlers to use React Router navigation

### 3. Additional Improvements
- Verified that the `/learning` route exists in `App.jsx` (it was already properly configured)
- Ensured all language switching functionality works across all pages
- Fixed translation consistency across the application

## Files Modified

1. `src/translations.js` - Added missing translation keys
2. `src/components/LearningPage.jsx` - Fixed language variable references
3. `src/components/CTAButtons.jsx` - Fixed navigation method

## Testing Results

✅ **Language Switching**: Now works correctly on all pages including AI Prompts page
✅ **Start Learning Button**: No longer causes black screen, navigation works properly
✅ **Learning Page**: Displays correctly in all languages (English, Armenian, Russian)
✅ **Cross-page Navigation**: All navigation between pages works smoothly
