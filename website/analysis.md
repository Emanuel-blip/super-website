## Analysis of Vibe Coding Page Issues

### 1. Vibe Coding Page Title Issue (`Vibe Coding_ը`)

**Observation**: When the language is set to Armenian, the Vibe Coding page title appears as "Vibe Coding_ը" instead of just "Vibe Coding".

**Root Cause**: 
- In `VibeCoding.jsx`, the title is rendered using `t('vibeCodeTitle')`.
- In `translations.js`, `vibeCodeTitle` for Armenian is correctly set to `Vibe Coding`.
- The `_ը` suffix is a grammatical particle in Armenian (definite article). It appears that this suffix is being appended dynamically to the `vibeCoding` string when it's used in certain contexts within the JSX, specifically in the `h2` tag for the section title "Vibe Coding Օրինակները" and "Vibe Coding-ի Ազդեցությունը".
- The `vibeCoding` key in `translations.js` is also used for the navigation link, which should remain 


just "Vibe Coding".

**Hypothesis**: The `_ը` suffix is likely being added by some external logic or a component that assumes a certain grammatical structure for Armenian words. It's not directly from the `translations.js` file.

### 2. Button Translation Issues (`startVibeCoding` and `viewExamples`)

**Observation**: The "Start Vibe Coding" and "View Examples" buttons on the Vibe Coding page do not translate when the language is changed.

**Root Cause**: 
- In `VibeCoding.jsx`, these buttons use `t("startVibeCoding")` and `t("viewExamples")`.
- In `translations.js`, `startVibeCoding` is defined, but `viewExamples` is not.

**Hypothesis**: The `startVibeCoding` button should translate if the key is correctly used. The `viewExamples` button is not translating because the key is missing in `translations.js`.

### 3. Navigation Bar Spacing Issue

**Observation**: The "Home" link in the navigation bar is too close to the `ai4all` logo when the language is changed to Armenian or English.

**Root Cause**: This is likely a CSS styling issue related to padding, margin, or flexbox properties in the navigation bar component.

**Hypothesis**: I need to inspect the CSS of the navigation bar component (likely `src/App.jsx` or a related header component) to adjust the spacing.
